In this repository, an attempt has been made to classify drinkers and non - drinkers based on body signal data given in the dataset 'smoking_drinking_dataset.csv'.
We attempt to analyse the data by employing data visualization texhniques using seaborn library. 
In this code, we explore Outlier handling using k - Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. 
The data is tested with 3 models - namely, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest Classifier. 
Some conclusions are made based on the performance metrics of the three models.
